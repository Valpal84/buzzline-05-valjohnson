## Project introduction
In this project we're going to use a producer and consumer to view sentiment analysis of several different authors and their messages. We're going to look and see if certain authors have more positive or negative sentiments over others. For this example, I'm going to compare one specific author 'Eve' to the others. You will see an average of Eve's sentiment analysis based on her messages, compared to the average sentiment analysis of the other authors. You will be able to visually see how Eve's sentiment analysis compares to the other authors via a line chart in which Eve will be represented by a green line and the others will be represented by a blue line.  

## Project insight
This project uses a kafka consumer that processes JSON messages from the kafka topic, the sentiment analysis is then stored in a SQLite database and you'll also see a chart showing the sentiment analysis comparison.

## Project calculations
For this project, individual messages are calculated for the author Eve, then averaged over the number of messages that have been produced. Also, the messages from the other authors are calculated for sentiment analysis and then averaged so they can be compared to Eve. This is interesting to see as you can then see how one particular author compares to the rest of them, this can easily be changed out for any other author with a simple code modification. 

See instructions below on how to start the producer and consumer to view the files necessary for the project. 

Nearly every streaming analytics system stores processed data somewhere for further analysis, historical reference, or integration with BI tools.

In this example project, we incorporate a relational data store. 
We use SQLite, but the example could be altered to work with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.

## Task 1. Use Tools from Module 1 and 2

Before starting, ensure you have completed the setup tasks in <https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-01-case> and <https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case> first. 

Versions matter. Python 3.11 is required. See the instructions for the required Java JDK and more. 

## Task 2. Copy This Example Project and Rename

Once the tools are installed, copy/fork this project into your GitHub account
and create your own version of this project to run and experiment with. 
Follow the instructions in [FORK-THIS-REPO.md](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-01-case/docs/FORK-THIS-REPO.md).

OR: For more practice, add these example scripts or features to your earlier project. 
You'll want to check requirements.txt, .env, and the consumers, producers, and util folders. 
Use your README.md to record your workflow and commands. 
    

## Task 3. Manage Local Project Virtual Environment

Follow the instructions in [MANAGE-VENV.md](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-01-case/docs/MANAGE-VENV.md) to:
1. Create your .venv
2. Activate .venv
3. Install the required dependencies using requirements.txt.

## Task 4. Start Zookeeper and Kafka (Takes 2 Terminals)

If Zookeeper and Kafka are not already running, you'll need to restart them.
See instructions at [SETUP-KAFKA.md] to:

1. Start Zookeeper Service ([link](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case/blob/main/docs/SETUP-KAFKA.md#step-7-start-zookeeper-service-terminal-1))
2. Start Kafka Service ([link](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case/blob/main/docs/SETUP-KAFKA.md#step-8-start-kafka-terminal-2))

## Task 5. Start a New Streaming Application

This will take two more terminals:

1. One to run the producer which writes messages. 
2. Another to run the consumer which reads messages, processes them, and writes them to a data store. 

### Producer (Terminal 3) 

Start the producer to generate the messages. 
The existing producer writes messages to a live data file in the data folder.
If Zookeeper and Kafka services are running, it will try to write them to a Kafka topic as well.
For configuration details, see the .env file. 

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal.
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the producer. 

Windows:

```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m producers.producer_case
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m producers.producer_case
```

The producer will still work if Kafka is not available.

### Consumer (Terminal 4) - Two Options

Start an associated consumer. 
You have two options. 
1. Start the consumer that reads from the live data file.
2. OR Start the consumer that reads from the Kafka topic.

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal in your root project folder. 
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the consumer. 

Windows:
```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m consumers.consumer_valjohnson
OR
py -m consumers.consumer_valjohnson
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m consumers.consumer_valjohnson
OR
python3 -m consumers.consumer_valjohnson
```

## Review the Project Code

Review the requirements.txt file. 
- What - if any - new requirements do we need for this project?
- Note that requirements.txt now lists both kafka-python and six. 
- What are some common dependencies as we incorporate data stores into our streaming pipelines?

Review the .env file with the environment variables.
- Why is it helpful to put some settings in a text file?
- As we add database access and passwords, we start to keep two versions: 
   - .evn 
   - .env.example
 - Read the notes in those files - which one is typically NOT added to source control?
 - How do we ignore a file so it doesn't get published in GitHub (hint: .gitignore)

Review the .gitignore file.
- What new entry has been added?

Review the code for the producer and the two consumers.
 - Understand how the information is generated by the producer.
 - Understand how the different consumers read, process, and store information in a data store?



## Save Space
To save disk space, you can delete the .venv folder when not actively working on this project.
You can always recreate it, activate it, and reinstall the necessary packages later. 
Managing Python virtual environments is a valuable skill.
